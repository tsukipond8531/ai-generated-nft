AI Generated NFT with Auctions and Marketplace is a decentralized platform on the Polygon Mumbai network that allows users to create, auction, and trade AI-generated NFTs. Using artificial intelligence, users can input a description to generate unique NFTs, which are stored on a secure smart contract. The platform also features auctions for limited edition NFTs and a marketplace for buying, selling, and voting on NFTs. This innovative platform combines AI technology with blockchain infrastructure, opening up new possibilities for digital asset ownership and trading.

## 🌋Usage

To use this project, navigate to the [AINFT. website](https://ai-generated-nft.vercel.app/) and input a description for the AI-generated image. The website will generate an image based on your description and display it on the screen. You can then decide whether to mint the NFT and sell it on the marketplace or enter it into an auction.
